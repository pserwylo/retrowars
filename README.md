RetroWars
=========

RetroWars is about competing against others, but having the choice about which game to play while you are competing. Essentially we can both be playing two completely separate games, but when I am successful in my game, crap rains down in your game, and vice-verca.

This game is built on the idea and a small amount of the code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/x-mulge/ which was a 3rd year Studio project for Monash University, by Cameron Weick and Peter Serwylo.
